# Welcome to the Spinal Segmentation Wiki!

This is a work in progress project where over the course of the next few weeks we'll be updating the wiki for information on how to use the module, and how we solved the spinal segmentation problem.

## Our approach to the problem

Currently there is no perfect way to solve a spinal segmentation problem. We're going to attempt to get accurate segmentations, and once we have the segmented images, we'd like to run an image reconigition algorithm to try and tell if the segmented image is a patient with scoliosis or not.

## User Guide
